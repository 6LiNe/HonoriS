# Bienvenue sur Surviv+ LiNe:Master! 😃 
(Sources: Photos:Youtube, Liens:GitHub, Code Dev 6LiNe)

C'est un cheat crée par [reuke] (https://github.com/reuke) mais durant sont absence, j'ai décider de le retravailler, et de le modifier!
Je crée donc une version anglaise avec explications simples.

This is a Surviv.io cheat loaded as a Chrome extension. It was originally developed by [reuke](https://github.com/reuke), but since he has been away, I've decided to take ownership of the development of the code.

## 🤔 FAQ
> **'Unauthorized extension use detected', how to fix?**

Fix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEEa6b3oXjA

> **"Please update extension for best results!" What does this mean??!!! WTF**

Official Download / Update Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRoCoMei3Nc

Calm down jeez. The hack was updated and therefore you need to update. Go to chrome://extensions/ and click remove on the survivio+ extension. Download the new version and load that one as the hack. There you go. No issues about this please.
> **What do I do if the cheat stops working?**

This usually means the game's code was patched (meaning they updated it where variables and functionality has changed). If this happens, the most you can do is create an issue. Give it some time and the cheat will work again.

> **This feature isn't working for me! WTF?**

Relax. Open the console (Hit F12), and copy what the error is, and just [create an issue](https://github.com/Kalaborative/survivio-cheat/issues). Do not open an issue if you already see the same one. If you do, you will be banned from using the cheat.

> **What is "bump fire"?**

This is a feature for specific non-automatic guns (guns that you cannot hold down the left-click to shoot). By holding down left-click for these guns, they fire at the fastest rate acting like an automatic. (Think of it like an autoclicker.)

> **Why isn't this on the Chrome Web Store?**

This was on the store before, but it got taken down (not sure why). I could try uploading it myself, but this will be the safest route for now.

> **Are pull requests allowed?**

Your contributions are always welcome. If you see something that should be improved or a feature added, feel free to fork this repo and create a PR. 

Merci a Kalaborativ
